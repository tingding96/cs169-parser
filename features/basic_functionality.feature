Feature: json and xml file upload
 
  As a calcentral developer
  So that I can see overlapping fields for models
  I want to upload json and xml files corresponding to each model and see their contents.

Scenario: Uploading a valid file with data for 3 new models
  Given I visit the file upload page
  When I upload a json file
  And I should be sent to the products index page

Scenario: Not uploading a file
  Given I visit the file upload page
  When I don't upload a file
  Then I should see "Please attach a valid file"
  And I should see the file upload page again
