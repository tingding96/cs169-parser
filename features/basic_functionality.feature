Feature: json and xml file upload

  As a calcentral developer
  So that I can see overlapping fields for models
  I want to upload json and xml files corresponding to each model and see their contents.

Scenario: Uploading a valid json file with data for 3 new models
  Given I visit the file upload page
  When I upload a json file
  Then I should see "was successfully created."
  And I should be sent to the products index page

  Scenario: Not uploading a file
   Given I visit the file upload page
   When I don't upload a file
   Then I should see "Please attach a valid file"
   And I should see the file upload page again

  Scenario: Uploading a valid xml file with data for 3 new models
    Given I visit the file upload page
    When I upload a xml file
    Then I should see "was successfully created."
    And I should be sent to the products index page



  Scenario: Uploading an invalid file that is not json or xml
    Given I visit the file upload page
    When I upload an invalid file
    Then I should see "Incompatible file type, please attach a valid file"
    And I should see the file upload page again
